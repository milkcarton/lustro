		Version history &amp; bugs
	</h1>

	<p>We hope to update Lustro on a regular basis with new features and bug fixes, check here to see what changed when.</p>

	<h3>Version 0.9 <span class="releasedate">2008.06</span></h3>

	<li><span>B&egrave;ta release, used for bug fixing</span></li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Found a bug?</h2>
	
	<p>Found a bug? Do you think you found something that doesn&apos;t work while it should? Make sure you upgraded your Mac OS X  with the latest security fixes (&lsquo;Software Update...&rsquo; under the Apple icon in the right top corner). <a href="http://www.milkcarton.be/" title="Our website" class="ext">Contact us</a> and tell us how we can reproduce the problem and we&apos;ll have a look at it. It&apos;s important you can tell us how to reproduce the problem (or it will be hard for us to know if it&apos;s fixed) and tell us your system details.</p>
	
	<p>For the geeky people out there: Lustro is open source so if you feel up to it go and download the source code (<a href="http://svn.milkcarton.be/lustro/" title="Lustro SVN repository" class="ext">Lustro SVN repository</a>), fix the problem and send us the patch. Eternal fame will be yours!</p>
