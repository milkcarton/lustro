		How do I get started?
	</h1>
	
	<p>This one should be too easy to explain but here are some hints if you would need them.</p>

	<ol>
		<li><span>Start Lustro, which you have or you wouldn&apos;t be reading this.</span></li>
		<li><span>Choose the export formats you want. You need to select at least on but can select all if you want.</span></li>
		<li><span>Click the lock icon and enter your Google username and password and click &lsquo;Sign In&rsquo; if you selected the Google option. You won&apos;t be able to export your contacts to Google if you are not signed in. You may choose to save your Google credentials in Keychain so that you don&apos;t have to enter it again.</span></li>
		<li><span>Press the &lsquo;Export&rsquo; and wait till the exports are finished.</span></li>
		<li><span>A small icon besides each selected export shows the status of the export. Once done it indicates if this export was successful or not.</span></li>
		<li><span>Check possible warnings or errors (if you see a warning or error icon) in the log file (Window &rarr; Show Log).</span></li>
	</ol>
